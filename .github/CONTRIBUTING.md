## How to Contribute

### Common Notice

Please write all descriptions in English for both issue and pull request. I am Japanese, so if you use Japanese language, you may be able to communicate more accurately, but here is an open space. Please understand to share content with more people.

### Issue

When you actually make issue, see [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE) for the format.

#### Bug Report

Bug reports are welcome. Feel free to write even small bugs in the [issues](https://github.com/skmatz/slack-progressing/issues). But don't write multiple bugs at the same issue, no matter how small they are. Please feel free to make many issues.

#### Feature Request

Any idea is welcome. If you have an idea but don't want to code it, feel free to tell me in the issue. If it's an interesting idea, I'll adopt it.

#### Ask

If you have any questions regarding implementation or specifications, please feel free to make an issue. Some projects dislike asking questions on issues, but since there is no forum in this project, I allow you to make issues for questions.

### Pull Request

When you actually make pull request, see [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for the format and the following style guides.

### Style Guide

#### Python Format

Basically, please write the code according to the rules defined in [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). In fact, I recommend auto format with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).
